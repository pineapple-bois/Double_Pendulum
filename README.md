#### The above figure shows simple pendulum suspended from another simple pendulum by a frictionless hinge. 
- Both pendulums move in the same plane. 
- In this system, the rods $OP_1$ and $P_1P_2$ are rigid, massless and inextensible.
- The system has two degrees of freedom and is uniquely determined by the values of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$

----

We solve the Euler-Lagrange equations for $\textbf{q} = [\theta_1, \theta_2]$ such that, 

$$
\frac{\text{d}}{\text{d}t}\left(\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{\textbf{q}}}\right)-\frac{\partial L}{\partial \textbf{q}}=0
$$

The result is a system of $|\textbf{q}|$ coupled, second-order differential equations

----

The equations are uncoupled by letting,

$$
\omega_i = \frac{\text{d} \theta_i}{\text{d} t}
$$
